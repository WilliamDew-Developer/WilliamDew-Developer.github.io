        <p>
          After graduating, I've been focused on learning frontend web
          development by taking Udemy classes and studying online. Using what I
          have learned so far, I made this game to practice DOM manipulation and
          handling events.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the challenges I faced was updating the scores on the page
          along with the corresponding scores within the program. It was also
          difficult to manipulate the styles whenever it was the other player's
          turn or when someone won the game. After a lot of head scratching and
          stackoverflowing, I finally achieved the result I was looking for.

        <h2>Better Workout Timer</h2>
        <img src="images/bwt-homepage.png" class="project-image" />
        <p>
          The Better Workout Timer was a project that I worked on with some
          classmates during the fall semester of 2020. We thought about how hard
          it was for people to exercise due to the pandemic, so we decided to
          make an app to help fix this. The purpose of the app is to motivate
          users to get active by allowing them to make their own workout
          routine, do a quick workout, or use a premade workout.
        </p>

        <p>
          A number of difficulties were faced during the span of this project.
          For starters, it was hard to communicate with the group. Due to the
          pandemic, I only met with my group via zoom as opposed to meeting up
          on campus to work together. It took some time to adjust to working
          remotely like this. Additionally, the frontend of the project was
          built using React Native. I wasn't particularly skilled in Javascript
          at the time so there was a bit of a learning curve. Despite the
          frustrations and setbacks, I pulled through and was able to contribute
          to the project.

        <p>
          This is another game that I made using vanilla JavaScript. I made this
          when I was first started learning JavaScript, so it provided great
          practice for me to learn the new syntax. I also got the chance to play
          around with changing styles based on certain events. This was also the
          first time I tried to manipulate the DOM.
