        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is William, I'm 23
          years old, and I am happy to have you here! I was born and raised in
          Atlanta, Georgia. I like dogs more than cats, basketball is my
          favorite sport, and my favorite food is pizza. In my free time, I like
          to play videogames, watch anime, and hang out with my friends. I’m
          also thinking about learning to play an instrument, the ukulele to be
          exact!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have recently graduated from Georgia Southern University with a
          Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I started my college career
          as a Mechanical Engineering major but found an interest in programming
          after working with a language called MATLAB. After my first year of
          school, I decided to switch my major to Computer Science and began my
          journey as a software developer. I learned the basics using Java and
          grew a passion for programming shortly after. I really enjoy the
          process of completing a programming project! Although it can be
          frustrating at times when my code doesn’t quite work, nothing beats
          the feeling of resolving my errors and seeing the finished product!

        <h2>What Programming Means to Me</h2>
        <p>
          When I think about programming, I like to compare it to making a
          jigsaw puzzle. Most of the time, you start with a big idea that’s too
          much to handle all at once. So instead, we break the idea into smaller
          (puzzle) pieces. As we complete more and more pieces of the puzzle, we
          eventually end up with a finished product. At that point, I can’t help
          but think about how far we’ve come in the process and I grow an
          appreciation for the entire experience!

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
          After taking different classes in school and learning from those with
          more experience, I've found an interest in web development. It’s
          really cool that you can run an entire application in the browser
          alone! I also appreciate how JavaScript’s syntax is far less strict
          than Java. Now that I’m out of school, I am currently taking Udemy
          courses to learn JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. My goal is to
          become a full stack developer! I also want to start a business where I
          build websites for clients. Eventually, I will try making mobile apps
          as well using JavaScript. I have a lot of goals but I’m sure that I
          can accomplish them as long as I stay patient, consistent, and eager
          to learn new things!
